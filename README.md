# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description
This application is a Google Books API search engine that allows users to search for books and save their searches. Initially built with a RESTful API, it has been refactored to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The app is built using the MERN stack:
- **MongoDB** for the database
- **Express.js** for the backend
- **React** for the frontend
- **Node.js** for the server
